# Allianz Technical Test Analysis Project

![Project Cover](link_to_your_cover_image.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing a technical test provided by Allianz for their interview process. The test involves studying datasets related to payments (or non-payments) of insurance premium installments contracted with an insurance company. The ultimate goal is to perform the necessary data analysis steps and build a Streamlit app for predicting whether a customer is suitable or not for the insurance service.

## Project Structure

- `datos/`: Contains datasets provided by Allianz.
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and exploration.
